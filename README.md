# ***Data-Mining-Cardiac-Arrhythmia***

<br>

## **â—¾ Introduction:**

*From a dataset about arrhythmias and the study on pre-processing, the repository aims to present and dicsuss the results obtained using the Decision Tree model J48 and the SVM Linear model in order to classify the mentioned data.*

<br>

## **â—¾ Pre-processing:**

- *Describse the database attributes, numerical and categorical, classifying according to scale (nominal or ratio) and cardinality (discreet, continuous, binary).*
- *Describes each of the attributes according to frequency, minimum and maximum value, day standard deviations, as appropriate.*
- *After the classification process with J48 has been used, it also evaluates the results of the processes below:* <br>

  ðŸ”¸   *Treat missing values* <br>
  ðŸ”¸   *Recognizing outliers* <br>
  ðŸ”¸   *Normalization* <br>

<br>

## **â—¾ Results:**

*In order to compare the different outcomes, we built a accuracy x method table for both Decision Tree and SVM Linear:*
